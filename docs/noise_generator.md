### **Noise Generator with Adjustable Noise Color and Blend Control for All Waveforms**

The **Noise Generator** is used to produce a random waveform that is useful in various synthesis applications, such as emulating natural sounds or adding randomness to modulation. This updated version includes features for **adjustable noise color or tone** and **blend control**, allowing you to shape the noise output and mix it with all generated waveforms (sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse) in an adjustable manner.

#### **1. Key Components**

- **NPN Transistor (Q1 - BC547)** for generating noise
- **Op-Amp (U6A - TL072 or similar)** for amplification and filtering
- **Op-Amp (U6B - TL072)** for mixing noise with waveforms
- **Resistors, Capacitors, and Potentiometers** for biasing, filtering, color adjustment, and blending

#### **Step-by-Step Schematic Routing**

##### **1. Transistor Noise Source**

- **NPN Transistor (Q1)**:
  - Use an **NPN transistor** such as **BC547**.
  - Connect the **collector** of **Q1** to **+12V** through a **resistor R15 (100kΩ)**.
  - Connect the **emitter** of **Q1** to **ground**.
  - The **base** of **Q1** should be left **floating** (unconnected) to allow thermal noise to be generated by the transistor.
  - The noise is generated by the random movement of charge carriers in the transistor junction, creating a broad-spectrum signal.

##### **2. Amplification Stage (Op-Amp U6A)**

- **Coupling Capacitor (C10)**:
  - Use a **coupling capacitor (C10, 10μF)** to block any DC component from the noise signal.
  - Connect **C10** between the **collector** of **Q1** and the **non-inverting input (+)** of **op-amp U6A**.

- **Amplification Resistor Network**:
  - Use a **resistor (R16, 1MΩ)** between the **non-inverting input (+)** of **U6A** and **ground** to provide a reference for the noise signal.
  - Add a **feedback resistor (R17, 470kΩ)** between the **output (pin 1)** of **U6A** and the **inverting input (-) (pin 2)** to set the gain of the amplification stage.
  - Connect a **resistor (R18, 10kΩ)** between the **inverting input (-)** of **U6A** and **ground**.

##### **3. Adjustable Noise Color Filtering**

- **Low-Pass and High-Pass Filtering**:
  - To provide adjustable noise color, use a combination of **low-pass** and **high-pass filters** with potentiometers.
  - **Low-Pass Filter**:
    - Add a **capacitor (C11, 10nF)** and a **potentiometer (RV6, 50kΩ)** in series between the **output of U6A** and **ground**.
    - The wiper of **RV6** should be connected back to the **output** of **U6A** through a **resistor (R19, 10kΩ)**. This allows you to adjust the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter, effectively controlling the high-frequency content of the noise.
  - **High-Pass Filter**:
    - Add a **capacitor (C14, 100nF)** in series with a **potentiometer (RV7, 50kΩ)** between the **output of U6A** and the **final noise output**.
    - The wiper of **RV7** acts as the output for the **high-pass filtered signal**, allowing control over the low-frequency content.

##### **4. Noise Blend Control for All Waveforms**

- **Mixing Noise with All Waveforms**:
  - To blend the noise with all generated waveforms (sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse), use a **dual op-amp mixer** configuration.
  - **Mixer Op-Amp (U6B - TL072)**:
    - Use an **op-amp U6B** for mixing the noise signal with other waveforms.
  - **Mixing Resistors**:
    - Use **resistor R20 (100kΩ)** to connect the **noise output** to the **inverting input (-)** of **U6B**.
    - Use **resistors R21, R23, R24, and R25 (100kΩ each)** to connect the **sawtooth, triangle, sine, and pulse wave outputs** respectively to the **inverting input (-)** of **U6B**.
  - **Blend Control Potentiometer (RV8)**:
    - Add a **potentiometer (RV8, 50kΩ)** between the **noise signal** and **ground** to adjust the amount of noise mixed in.
    - The **wiper** of **RV8** should be connected to the **inverting input (-)** of **U6B** through **R20** to allow the adjustment from **no noise** to **a lot of noise**.
  - **Feedback Resistor**:
    - Connect a **resistor (R22, 100kΩ)** between the **output (pin 7)** of **U6B** and the **inverting input (-)** to set the gain for the mixer stage.

##### **5. Power Supply for Op-Amp (U6A & U6B)**

- **Power Supply**:
  - Ensure **pin 8** of **U6A and U6B** is connected to **+12V**, and **pin 4** is connected to **-12V**.

- **Decoupling Capacitors**:
  - Place **decoupling capacitors (C12, C13 - 100nF each)** between **+12V and ground** and **-12V and ground** to filter any power supply noise.

### **Utilizing CD40106 for Independent Noise Blending with Each Waveform**

To achieve independent noise blending with each waveform output (sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse), the remaining 5 op-amps in the **CD40106** can be utilized as noise buffers. This solution ensures that each waveform can have an isolated noise blend without any interaction or interference between them.

#### **Solution Overview**

1. **Noise Buffering Using CD40106**:
   - The **CD40106** has **Schmitt trigger inverters** that can be used as buffers to create individual noise signals for each waveform.
   - Each of the remaining inverters in the **CD40106** will be used to buffer the noise output, allowing isolated distribution of the noise to the respective waveforms.

2. **Noise Routing and Blending**:
   - The **output of the noise amplifier (U5A)** will be the **common noise signal**.
   - This common noise signal will be routed to the **inputs of 5 separate inverters** in the **CD40106**.
   - Each inverter output will provide an isolated noise signal for blending with a specific waveform.

3. **Blending Noise with Each Waveform**:
   - The **outputs of the CD40106 inverters** will be used to blend noise with the waveforms (sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse).
   - **Blend Control**: A **blend potentiometer (e.g., RV8)** will be used in series between each inverter output and the waveform to adjust the noise level individually for each waveform.
   - The noise from each inverter will then be connected to the respective waveform channel using a **mixing resistor (e.g., R21, R22, R23, R24)**.

4. **Summing Amplifier for Each Waveform**:
   - Each waveform (e.g., sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse) will have a dedicated **op-amp summing stage** (using available op-amp sections in **TL072** or another op-amp).
   - This op-amp stage will sum the original waveform signal and the buffered noise signal, providing the final blended output for each waveform.

#### **Step-by-Step Updated Schematic Routing**

1. **Noise Source and Amplification**:
   - **Transistor Noise Source (Q1 - BC547)**: Connect the **collector** of **Q1** to **+12V** via **R15 (100kΩ)**. The **emitter** of **Q1** is connected to **ground**.
   - The **base** of **Q1** is left **floating** to generate thermal noise.
   - The noise signal is then coupled through **C8 (10μF)** to the **non-inverting input (+)** of **op-amp U5A (TL072)**.
   - **R16 (1MΩ)** sets a reference for the **non-inverting input (+)**, while **R17 (470kΩ)** and **R18 (10kΩ)** set the gain for the amplification stage.
   - The amplified noise signal is available at the **output of U5A (pin 1)**.

2. **Distribute Noise to CD40106 Inverters**:
   - **Amplified Noise Output**: Connect the output of **U5A** (pin 1) to the **inputs of 5 separate inverters** in the **CD40106** (e.g., pins 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11).
   - Each inverter will output a buffered version of the noise signal.

3. **Noise Blending for Each Waveform**:
   - **Inverter Outputs**: The **outputs of the inverters** (e.g., pins 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12) will each provide an isolated noise signal.
   - **Blend Control for Each Waveform**:
     - Connect the **output of each inverter** to a **blend potentiometer (RV8)**.
     - The **wiper** of each potentiometer should be connected to a **mixing resistor** (**R21, R22, R23, R24**).
     - The other side of each mixing resistor will connect to the respective waveform channel for blending.
   - **Waveform Channels**:
     - **Sawtooth Waveform**: Blend noise output through **R21 (100kΩ)**.
     - **Triangle Waveform**: Blend noise output through **R22 (100kΩ)**.
     - **Sine Waveform**: Blend noise output through **R23 (100kΩ)**.
     - **Pulse Waveform**: Blend noise output through **R24 (100kΩ)**.

4. **Summing Amplifier for Blended Output**:
   - **Summing Amplifier Setup**: Use an available op-amp section (e.g., **U6A, U6B** from **TL072**) to sum the **original waveform** and the **noise signal**.
   - **Waveform Input**: Connect the original waveform output (e.g., sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse) to the **non-inverting input (+)** of the respective op-amp.
   - **Noise Input**: Connect the **noise signal** (after blending resistor) to the **inverting input (-)** of the op-amp through a **mixing resistor**.
   - **Feedback Resistor**: Use a **feedback resistor (R25 - 100kΩ)** between the **output** and the **inverting input (-)** of each op-amp to set the gain for the blended output.
   - The **output of each op-amp** will be the **final blended waveform**, which can be routed to the output jacks or further processing stages.

#### **Advantages of This Approach**

1. **Independent Noise Control**: Each waveform can have its own independent noise level, ensuring that the noise blend for one waveform does not affect the others.
2. **No Signal Interaction**: Since each waveform has a dedicated noise buffer, there is no cross-talk or interference between waveforms.
3. **Effective Use of CD40106**: Utilizing the remaining inverters in the **CD40106** helps to minimize the need for additional components and make efficient use of available resources.

#### **Considerations**

- **Noise Characteristics**: The **CD40106** inverters introduce a Schmitt trigger characteristic, which may slightly shape the noise signal. However, this should still be suitable for blending with analog signals in most synthesizer applications.
- **Decoupling**: Ensure proper decoupling of the power supply pins of the **CD40106** to maintain stability and reduce noise.
