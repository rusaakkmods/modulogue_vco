### **Utilizing CD40106 for Independent Noise Blending with Each Waveform**

To achieve independent noise blending with each waveform output (sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse), the remaining 5 op-amps in the **CD40106** can be utilized as noise buffers. This solution ensures that each waveform can have an isolated noise blend without any interaction or interference between them.

#### **Solution Overview**

1. **Noise Buffering Using CD40106**:
   - The **CD40106** has **Schmitt trigger inverters** that can be used as buffers to create individual noise signals for each waveform.
   - Each of the remaining inverters in the **CD40106** will be used to buffer the noise output, allowing isolated distribution of the noise to the respective waveforms.

2. **Noise Routing and Blending**:
   - The **output of the noise amplifier (U5A)** will be the **common noise signal**.
   - This common noise signal will be routed to the **inputs of 5 separate inverters** in the **CD40106**.
   - Each inverter output will provide an isolated noise signal for blending with a specific waveform.

3. **Blending Noise with Each Waveform**:
   - The **outputs of the CD40106 inverters** will be used to blend noise with the waveforms (sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse).
   - **Blend Control**: A **blend potentiometer (e.g., RV8)** will be used in series between each inverter output and the waveform to adjust the noise level individually for each waveform.
   - The noise from each inverter will then be connected to the respective waveform channel using a **mixing resistor (e.g., R21, R22, R23, R24)**.

4. **Summing Amplifier for Each Waveform**:
   - Each waveform (e.g., sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse) will have a dedicated **op-amp summing stage** (using available op-amp sections in **TL072** or another op-amp).
   - This op-amp stage will sum the original waveform signal and the buffered noise signal, providing the final blended output for each waveform.

#### **Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. **Noise Source and Amplification**:
   - Keep the existing noise generator circuit intact, up to the **amplification and filtering stages** using **U5A**.
   - The **output of U5A** serves as the **common noise signal**.

2. **Buffering Noise with CD40106**:
   - **Connect the noise output** from **U5A** to the **inputs of 5 separate inverters** in the **CD40106**.
   - Each inverter will provide an isolated noise output for blending.

3. **Noise Blending for Each Waveform**:
   - **Inverter Outputs**: Use the outputs of the 5 inverters to feed the noise signal to each waveform:
     - **Sawtooth**: One inverter output goes to blend with the sawtooth waveform.
     - **Triangle**: One inverter output goes to blend with the triangle waveform.
     - **Sine**: One inverter output goes to blend with the sine waveform.
     - **Pulse**: One inverter output goes to blend with the pulse waveform.
   - **Blend Control**: Use a **potentiometer (e.g., RV8)** in series between each inverter output and the respective waveform blending resistor to adjust the noise level for each waveform individually.
   - **Mixing Resistors**: Connect each potentiometer wiper to a **mixing resistor (R21, R22, R23, R24)**, which will blend the noise with the respective waveform.

4. **Summing Amplifier for Blended Output**:
   - Use an op-amp stage (e.g., from **TL072**) to sum the **original waveform signal** and the **noise signal** from the corresponding inverter.
   - This op-amp will output the **final blended signal** for each waveform.

#### **Advantages of This Approach**

1. **Independent Noise Control**: Each waveform can have its own independent noise level, ensuring that the noise blend for one waveform does not affect the others.
2. **No Signal Interaction**: Since each waveform has a dedicated noise buffer, there is no cross-talk or interference between waveforms.
3. **Effective Use of CD40106**: Utilizing the remaining inverters in the **CD40106** helps to minimize the need for additional components and make efficient use of available resources.

#### **Considerations**

- **Noise Characteristics**: The **CD40106** inverters introduce a Schmitt trigger characteristic, which may slightly shape the noise signal. However, this should still be suitable for blending with analog signals in most synthesizer applications.
- **Decoupling**: Ensure proper decoupling of the power supply pins of the **CD40106** to maintain stability and reduce noise.
