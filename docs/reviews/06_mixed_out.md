### **Review of Blended Output Mixer Stage**

#### **Mixing Stage**
1. **Blended Outputs Routing**:
   - The blended outputs (**BLEND SAW, BLEND TRI, BLEND SINE, BLEND PULSE**) are each connected through individual resistors (**R30, R31, R32, R33 - 100kΩ each**) to the **inverting input (-)** of **U10B (TL072)**.
   - This configuration ensures that all blended signals are summed together at the inverting input.

2. **Non-Inverting Input**:
   - The **non-inverting input (+)** of **U10B** is connected to **ground** to maintain a reference voltage of 0V, ensuring proper operation of the op-amp in an inverting summing configuration.

3. **Feedback Resistor**:
   - A **feedback resistor (R34 - 100kΩ)** is connected between the **output (pin 7)** of **U10B** and the **inverting input (-) (pin 6)**. This sets the gain of the summing amplifier to unity, meaning the output is a direct sum of all inputs without additional amplification.

4. **Mixed Output**:
   - The **output (pin 7)** of **U10B** provides the **combined output (MIX OUT)**, which is the sum of all the blended waveforms (SAW, TRI, SINE, PULSE). This output can be used as the final audio signal or sent to further processing stages.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Adjustable Mixing**:
   - If you need to adjust the contribution of each waveform in the final mix, consider making **R30, R31, R32, R33** variable resistors (potentiometers). This will allow fine-tuning of the level of each blended waveform in the final output.

2. **Power Supply Decoupling**:
   - Ensure that **100nF decoupling capacitors** are placed close to the power pins of **U10B** to stabilize the power supply and reduce noise.

### **Summary**
- The current mixing stage configuration is correct and will successfully sum all blended waveform signals into one mixed output.
- Using **TL072** as the summing op-amp is appropriate for maintaining the analog characteristics of the signal.
- Adding variable resistors for individual waveform level control can provide more flexibility in the final mixed output.
