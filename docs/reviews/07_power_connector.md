### **Review of Eurorack Power Connector Schematic**

#### **Power Connector (J9)**:
- The power connector (J9) follows the standard Eurorack convention with the following pin configuration:
  - Pins 1, 2: **-12V**
  - Pins 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: **GND**
  - Pins 9, 10: **+12V**
  - Pins 11, 12: **+5V**
  - Pins 13, 14: **CV IN (Optional)**
  - Pins 15, 16: **GATE (Optional)**
- The layout is consistent with typical Eurorack power distribution and ensures correct voltage connections.

#### **Diode Protection (D7, D8, D9)**:
- Each power rail (**+12V, -12V, +5V**) is protected by a **Schottky diode** (1N5819).
- The diodes are oriented correctly:
  - **Anode** connected to the incoming power line.
  - **Cathode** connected to the respective power rail input.
- This configuration provides reverse polarity protection, ensuring the circuit is safeguarded from incorrect connections.

#### **Filtering Capacitors**:
- **100nF Ceramic Capacitors** (C28, C29, C32) are placed for high-frequency noise filtering on each power line.
- **47µF Electrolytic Capacitors** (C30, C31, C33) are used for bulk decoupling, reducing power ripple on each power line.
- Capacitors are properly positioned between the power rails (**+12V, -12V, +5V**) and **GND**, providing effective filtering.

#### **Power Indicator LED (D10)**:
- The **LED (D10)** is used for power indication on the **+5V** rail.
- The **1kΩ series resistor (R35)** is used to limit the current flowing through the LED, preventing damage.
- The LED is oriented correctly, with the **anode** connected to the +5V rail through **R35** and the **cathode** connected to **GND**.
- This configuration ensures that the LED lights up when +5V power is present, providing a clear visual indication of power status.

#### **Recommendations**:
- The schematic appears to be functionally correct, with appropriate protection and filtering measures for the power rails.
- The **single LED** for power indication on the **+5V line** is configured correctly.
- Ensure that the capacitor values (100nF and 47µF) are suitable for your power requirements and provide adequate noise suppression.
