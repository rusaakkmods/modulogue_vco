### **Noise Generator Schematic Review with Adjustable Noise Color and Blend Control for All Waveforms**

The schematic provided appears largely correct for the intended purpose of generating noise and blending it with other waveforms. Below, I outline the review details and the recommended Bill of Materials (BOM).

#### **1. Review Summary**

1. **Transistor Noise Source (Q1 - BC547)**:
   - The **collector** of Q1 is correctly connected to **+12V** via **R15 (100kΩ)**.
   - The **emitter** of Q1 is connected to **ground**, which is correct.
   - The **base** is floating, which is needed for generating thermal noise. This is correct.

2. **Amplification Stage (U5A - TL072)**:
   - The **collector** of Q1 is connected to **C8 (10μF)**, which then goes to the **non-inverting input (+)** of **U5A**. This setup correctly blocks DC.
   - **R16 (1MΩ)** sets a reference to **ground** for the **non-inverting input**, which is correct.
   - The **feedback network** using **R17 (470kΩ)** and **R18 (10kΩ)** is correctly setting the gain of the op-amp. This part is also correct.

3. **Noise Filtering (High-Pass and Low-Pass)**:
   - **C10 (100nF)** and **RV7 (50kΩ)** are in the correct position for the **high-pass filter**.
   - **C9 (10nF)** and **RV6 (50kΩ)** form a **low-pass filter** with **R19 (10kΩ)** for adjusting the cutoff frequency. This is correctly implemented.

4. **Mixer Stage for Noise Blend (U5B - TL072)**:
   - **Noise output** is correctly connected through **R20 (100kΩ)** to the **inverting input (-)** of **U5B**.
   - The **blend control potentiometer (RV8, 50kΩ)** is correctly connected between the **noise signal** and **ground**, allowing control over the amount of noise mixed.
   - The **feedback resistor (R25, 100kΩ)** correctly sets the gain of the mixer stage.
   - The resistors (**R21, R22, R23, R24 - 100kΩ each**) connect the individual waveform outputs (sawtooth, triangle, sine, pulse) to the mixer input, allowing noise blending with each waveform.

5. **Power Supply**:
   - The power supply connections for **U5A and U5B** are not visible, but it's essential that **+12V** and **-12V** are connected to **pins 8** and **4** respectively, with proper **decoupling capacitors** to stabilize the supply.

#### **Recommendations**

- **Decoupling Capacitors**:
  - Ensure **C12 and C13 (100nF)** are placed as close as possible to the power pins of **U5A and U5B** for proper filtering of any power supply noise.

- **Output Clarity**:
  - If you want to individually blend each waveform output with the noise, make sure each waveform signal path passes through a dedicated **blend control** (like **RV8**) before being output. This ensures each waveform has an independent noise control, rather than a global control for all.

### **Updated Schematic Review: Noise Generation & Waveform Blending**

#### **Noise Generation & Processing Section**:
1. **Noise Transistor (U3B - CA3086/3046, Q3)**:
   - **Q3** is correctly configured for noise generation.
   - The biasing through **R15 (100kΩ)** and the decoupling capacitor **C8 (10μF)** seem appropriate for generating a random noise signal.
   
2. **Amplification Stage (U5A - TL072)**:
   - The noise signal is amplified using **U5A**.
   - **R16 (1MΩ)** provides biasing for the non-inverting input.
   - The gain network using **R17 (470kΩ)** and **R18 (10kΩ)** appears to be set for appropriate amplification levels.
   - **Test Point TP5** allows verification of the amplified noise signal.

3. **High Pass and Low Pass Noise Filters**:
   - The signal is processed through a **High-Pass Filter** using **C10 (100nF)**, with adjustable cutoff via **RV7 (50kΩ)**.
   - **Low-Pass Filtering** is achieved with **C9 (10nF)** and **RV6 (50kΩ)** to control the noise tone, allowing adjustable filtering for different noise colors.

4. **Filtered Noise Amplification (U5B - TL072)**:
   - The filtered noise is further amplified through **U5B**, using **R20 (100kΩ)** and **R25 (100kΩ)**.
   - **RV8 (50kΩ)** provides further adjustment to control the output level of the filtered noise.
   - **Test Point TP7** allows for measurement and verification of the filtered noise output.

#### **Waveform Blending Section**:
1. **Buffered Noise (U10A - TL072)**:
   - **U10A** buffers the amplified noise output, providing a stable **Buffered Noise Output** at **TP13**.

2. **Waveform Mixing with Noise**:
   - Each waveform (saw, tri, sine, pulse) is individually mixed with the filtered noise.
   - **JFETs (Q3 - Q6, 2N5457)** are used for blending the noise with the corresponding waveforms, controlled through envelope followers (**D3 - D6**).
   - The blending process is managed by **U6A, U6B, U7A, and U7B (TL072)**, each having a gain resistor configuration (e.g., **R21 - R29**).
   - **Test Points (TP9 - TP12)** allow for monitoring the waveform before it is blended with noise.
   - Each blend output (e.g., **Blend SAW, Blend TRI, etc.**) is buffered and available for further routing.

#### **Recommendations**:
1. **Gain Adjustment for Blending Stage**:
   - You may consider adding trimmer potentiometers in series with resistors **R21 - R24** to allow finer control of the noise blending level for each waveform.

2. **Envelope Follower Configuration**:
   - The diodes **D3 - D6 (1N4148)** are properly configured to rectify the signal for use in controlling the noise blending. Make sure the capacitor values are suitable to prevent overly fast or slow envelope response, which could impact blending behavior.

3. **Decoupling Capacitors**:
   - It is always good to ensure that all op-amps have proper decoupling capacitors close to their power pins for noise suppression. Add **100nF** caps if they are not already present.
