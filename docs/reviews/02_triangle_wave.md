### **Review of Triangle Wave Shaper Schematic**

Based on the schematic you provided, here’s my review:

#### **Key Points for the Triangle Wave Shaper Schematic**

1. **Sawtooth Wave Input**:
   - The **sawtooth waveform (SAW)** is correctly connected to **resistor R4 (1kΩ)**, which then goes to one of the **outer terminals of the potentiometer (RV2, 10kΩ)**.
   - This matches the intended function, where the potentiometer adjusts the ratio of the input waveform and ground.

2. **Potentiometer Wiring (RV2)**:
   - The **middle wiper** of the **potentiometer (RV2)** is connected to the **inverting input (-)** of the op-amp **U1B**.
   - The **other outer terminal** of **RV2** is connected to **ground** through **R5 (1kΩ)**, which helps in providing a stable reference for symmetry adjustment.
   - This setup correctly allows for adjusting the symmetry of the waveform by controlling the ratio between the input signal and ground.

3. **Feedback Resistor (R6)**:
   - The **feedback resistor (R6, 10kΩ)** is properly connected between the **output of U1B** (pin 7) and the **inverting input (-)** (pin 6).
   - This is essential for defining the gain and shaping the triangle wave.

4. **Non-Inverting Input (+) of U1B**:
   - The **non-inverting input (+)** (pin 5) is correctly connected to **ground**. This provides the required reference point for accurate operation of the triangle wave shaping.

5. **Power Supply for Op-Amp (U1C)**:
   - **C2 and C3 (100nF each)** are used as **decoupling capacitors** between the **±12V supplies** and **ground**. This helps stabilize the power and reduce noise.
   - **Pin 8** of **U1C** is connected to **+12V**, and **pin 4** is connected to **-12V**, which is correct for powering the TL072 op-amp.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**

- **Add a Small Capacitor Across R6** (Optional):
  - Adding a small capacitor (e.g., **10pF to 33pF**) in parallel with **R6** could help reduce high-frequency oscillations and make the waveform smoother.

- **Range Limitation Resistors** (Optional):
  - To prevent the potentiometer from completely distorting the waveform, you could consider adding small **fixed resistors** (e.g., **1kΩ**) in series with both sides of the potentiometer. This will help in limiting the extreme positions of the potentiometer.

#### **Summary**

The schematic you provided is mostly correct for achieving an adjustable **triangle wave shaper**. The **connections to the potentiometer (RV2)**, **feedback resistor (R6)**, and the **non-inverting input** of the op-amp are all correct. This configuration should allow you to adjust the **symmetry** of the triangle wave effectively. The addition of **decoupling capacitors** is also appropriate for reducing power supply noise.
