### **Review of Sawtooth Core Oscillator Schematic (Ramp Core with CA3086/3046)**

This document provides a detailed review of the **Sawtooth Core Oscillator** schematic using the **CA3086/3046** transistor array for a VCO design. The analysis covers the key components, connections, and suggestions for improving the design.

#### **Key Observations**

1. **Op-Amp Integrator (U1A - TL072)**:
   - The **inverting input (-)** is correctly connected to **resistor R1 (100kΩ)**, which determines the charging rate.
   - **Capacitor C1 (22nF)** is properly connected between the **output of U1A** and the **inverting input** to perform the integration.
   - The **non-inverting input (+)** is connected to **ground**, which is also correct.

2. **Transistor Array (U3A - CA3086/3046)**:
   - **Q1 and Q2** from **CA3086/3046** are configured correctly for the exponential converter.
   - **CV IN** is connected to the **bases of Q1 and Q2**, which is correct.
   - **Collectors of Q1 and Q2** are connected as follows:
     - **Q1 Collector**: Connected to **R1** (which leads to the op-amp input) — this is correct for setting up the current source for integration.
     - **Q2 Collector**: Connected to **+12V**, which provides the supply voltage for the current mirror configuration. This connection is also correct.
   - The **emitters of Q1 and Q2** are tied together and connected to **ground via R3 (1kΩ)**. This provides a common reference point and helps maintain temperature stability — this is a correct approach for maintaining good thermal tracking.

3. **Reset Mechanism (Q2 and CD40106)**:
   - The **Schmitt Trigger (U2B - CD40106)** is used to reset the integrator when the output reaches a certain level:
     - The **input of U2B (Pin 1)** is connected to the **output of U1A** — this is correct for monitoring the integrator output.
     - The **output of U2B (Pin 2)** is connected to **RV1 (100kΩ)**, which is tied to **ground**. This sets the threshold for the Schmitt Trigger to control the reset action.
     - **Q2 (2N3904)** is used to discharge the capacitor and reset the integrator:
       - **Base of Q2** is connected to the **output of the Schmitt Trigger** via **R2 (10kΩ)** — this is correct.
       - **Collector of Q2** is connected to the **junction of C1 and U1A** — this allows Q2 to discharge the capacitor.
       - **Emitter of Q2** is connected to **ground**, which is correct.

#### **Summary of the Schematic Review**

The schematic appears to be **correct** for the **Sawtooth Core Oscillator** using the **CA3086/3046**. All key connections, including the **exponential converter**, **integrator**, and **reset mechanism**, are implemented correctly.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Thermal Tracking**:
   - Ensure **Q1 and Q2** are physically close together, with **thermal compound** or **shrink tubing**, to maintain consistent temperature conditions for better stability.

2. **Power Decoupling**:
   - Add **decoupling capacitors** (e.g., **100nF**) near the power supply pins of the **TL072** and **CA3086/3046** to improve stability and reduce noise.
   - Use one **decoupling capacitor for each supply rail** (±12V):
     - Place **100nF capacitors** between **+12V** and **ground**, and **-12V** and **ground**, close to each IC.
     - Adding a larger **bulk capacitor** (e.g., **10μF - 47μF electrolytic**) across the power rails may further stabilize the power supply, especially if there are transient currents or higher-frequency components present.

Using these suggestions will help improve the stability and performance of your **Sawtooth Core Oscillator** design.

### **Review of Ramp Core Schematic**

#### **General Overview**:
- The schematic appears to be designed for a ramp core oscillator with additional buffering stages using CD40106 Schmitt Trigger inverters.
- The use of a **TL072 operational amplifier** (U1A) for the integrator circuit is typical and suitable for generating a stable ramp waveform.

#### **Key Components**:
1. **Operational Amplifier (U1A - TL072)**:
   - The **TL072** is used to generate the ramp waveform.
   - **Capacitor (C1)**: The value of **22nF** sets the oscillator frequency range, along with **R1 (100kΩ)** and **RV1 (100kΩ variable resistor)**.
   - Ensure **C1** has a low tolerance for frequency stability.

2. **Transistor (Q2 - 2N3904)**:
   - **Q2** acts as a current sink, discharging the integrator capacitor to reset the ramp waveform.
   - The **base** of **Q2** should be connected to an appropriate control signal that determines the ramp frequency. This signal appears to be routed correctly in the schematic.

3. **Current Mirrors (U3A - CA3086/3046)**:
   - The **CA3086/3046** transistor array is used for the current mirror to control the ramp generation process.
   - Ensure that **Q1** and **Q2** are thermally coupled for better temperature stability, as this affects the pitch stability of the VCO.

4. **CD40106 Schmitt Trigger (U2)**:
   - **U2B** is used to shape the ramp waveform into a buffered signal for the **sawtooth output**.
   - The other stages of the **CD40106** (U2C, U2D, etc.) are available for use in buffering or further processing, which adds versatility to the circuit.

#### **Power Supply and Decoupling**:
- **CD40106 Power Supply (U2A)**: Properly decoupled using **C21 (100nF)** between **Vdd** and **GND** to suppress power supply noise.
- Make sure all ICs are properly decoupled close to the power pins to avoid oscillations and unwanted noise.

#### **Output Buffering**:
- **Sawtooth Output (OTP1)** is connected through the Schmitt trigger inverter (U2B) to **R2 (10kΩ)**, providing a low impedance buffered output.
- Verify the threshold levels of the **Schmitt trigger** to ensure it properly triggers based on the generated ramp signal levels.

#### **Recommendations**:
- The **sawtooth waveform** output seems to be well-buffered, but the Schmitt trigger's threshold voltages should be checked to ensure it doesn't distort the ramp waveform.
- For the **current mirror** transistors in **U3A (CA3086/3046)**, consider adding a small heatsink or ensuring they are mounted close together to improve thermal tracking and reduce drift.
- The **variable resistor (RV1)** allows fine-tuning of the frequency; ensure this component has a stable and smooth adjustment to prevent frequency jitter.
