### **Review of Updated Noise and Waveform Blending Schematic**

#### **Noise Generation and Amplification**
1. **BC547 (Q1)**: Correctly configured for noise generation.
   - The **collector** is connected to **+12V** via **R15 (100kΩ)**.
   - The **emitter** is connected to **ground**, allowing for thermal noise generation.
   - The generated noise is then coupled through **C8 (10μF)** to the **non-inverting input (+)** of **U5A (TL072)**.
   - **R16 (1MΩ)** sets the reference voltage, while **R17 (470kΩ)** and **R18 (10kΩ)** set the gain for amplifying the noise.

#### **Noise Filtering and Buffering**
2. **Noise Filtering**:
   - **High-pass filter**: **C10 (100nF)** and **RV7 (50kΩ)** form a high-pass filter to control the high-frequency content of the noise.
   - **Low-pass filter**: **C9 (10nF)**, **R19 (10kΩ)**, and **RV6 (50kΩ)** form a low-pass filter to control the low-frequency content.
3. **Filtered Noise Amplification**:
   - **U5B (TL072)** amplifies the filtered noise. The configuration with **R20 (100kΩ)**, **RV8 (50kΩ)**, and **R25 (100kΩ)** appears correct for controlling the amplification.
4. **Buffered Noise**:
   - **U10A (TL072)** is configured as a **voltage follower** to buffer the noise. The **output (pin 1)** is directly connected to the **inverting input (-) (pin 2)**, ensuring a unity gain configuration.
   - The buffered noise output is labeled as **Buffered Noise Out**, and this is correctly used in subsequent blending stages.

#### **Envelope Follower Configuration**
1. **Diode-Capacitor Setup**:
   - Each waveform (SAW, TRI, SINE, PULSE) has an associated envelope follower consisting of:
     - **Diodes (D3, D4, D5, D6)** to pass only the positive part of the waveform.
     - **Capacitors (C13, C14, C15, C16 - 10μF)** to smooth the waveform into a DC control voltage.
   - This configuration is correct for generating an envelope control voltage for each waveform.

#### **JFET-Based VCA and Waveform Mixing**
1. **JFET Configuration**:
   - The **2N5457 JFETs (Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6)** are correctly used for noise modulation.
   - The **drains** are connected to the **buffered noise output** from **U10A**.
   - The **gates** are connected to the control voltage from the envelope followers, with **100kΩ resistors (R21, R22, R23, R24)** setting the control sensitivity.
   - The **sources** are connected to the summing op-amp stage.
2. **Summing Mixer Configuration**:
   - **Op-Amps (U6A, U6B, U7A, U7B - TL072)** are configured as summing mixers for each waveform.
   - **Mixing resistors (R21, R22, R23, R24 - 100kΩ)** are used to blend the waveform with the noise component.
   - **Feedback resistors (R26, R27, R28, R29 - 100kΩ)** set the gain for the summing stage.

#### **Power Supply Considerations**
1. **Power Supply Decoupling**:
   - Ensure **100nF decoupling capacitors** are placed close to each op-amp's power pins to stabilize the power supply.
2. **Op-Amp Power Connections**:
   - All op-amps are connected to **+12V (VCC)** and **-12V (VEE)**, which is correct for ensuring proper bipolar operation.

### **Summary**
- The schematic appears correct, with appropriate configurations for noise generation, filtering, buffering, envelope following, JFET modulation, and waveform blending.
- Replacing the **CD40106** Schmitt trigger with **TL072** op-amps for noise buffering is a good decision to maintain the analog characteristics of the noise.
