### **Review of Updated Sine Wave Shaper Schematic**

Based on the updated schematic provided, here’s a detailed review of the changes:

#### **Key Observations**

1. **Triangle Wave Input (R9)**:
   - The **triangle wave input (TRI)** is correctly connected to the **inverting input (-)** of the op-amp **U4A (TL072)** through **resistor R9 (10kΩ)**.
   - This configuration is correct, as it limits the input signal amplitude to the appropriate level for shaping.

2. **Triangle Corner Shaping Potentiometer (RV4)**:
   - The **potentiometer RV4 (10kΩ)** is correctly connected in the **shaping network**.
   - The **wiper of RV4** is connected to the **junction point** of the **inverting input (-)** of **U4A** and the **diodes D1 and D2**.
   - **R8 and R7 (1kΩ each)** are now connected in series with each side of **RV4**, which helps limit the adjustment range, preventing over-clipping and distortion. This is a good improvement to ensure more control over the shaping without causing excessive signal alteration.

3. **Diode Shaping Network (D1, D2)**:
   - **Diodes D1 and D2 (1N4148)** are placed in **opposite directions**, with their junction meeting at the **inverting input (-)** of the op-amp. The **free ends** of the diodes are correctly connected to **ground**.
   - This configuration allows the diodes to act as a soft clipping element, rounding the triangle wave into a sine-like shape. The routing is correct and should yield the desired waveform transformation.

4. **Feedback Network (R10, C7)**:
   - **R10 (10kΩ)** is connected between the **output (pin 1)** of **U4A** and the **inverting input (-) (pin 2)**, providing the necessary feedback for proper op-amp operation.
   - **Capacitor C7 (10pF - 33pF)** is added in parallel with **R10** to filter high-frequency noise and ensure smoother sine wave shaping, which is appropriate.

5. **Amplitude Control Potentiometer (RV3)**:
   - **RV3 (50kΩ)** is placed at the output of **U4A**, with one **outer terminal** connected to the **op-amp output** and the **other outer terminal** to **ground**.
   - The **wiper** acts as the **adjustable output**, allowing control over the sine wave amplitude. This is correctly implemented to provide versatility in adjusting output levels.

6. **Power Supply for Op-Amp (U4A)**:
   - Although the power supply is not explicitly shown here, ensure that **pin 8** is connected to **+12V** and **pin 4** is connected to **-12V**, with **decoupling capacitors (100nF)** between each supply pin and ground for noise reduction.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**

- The **series resistors (R7 and R8, 1kΩ)** that are added with **RV4** are a good addition, as they help limit the adjustment range of the potentiometer, preventing unwanted excessive clipping.
- Ensure that the **ground connections** are solid and do not introduce additional noise. Proper grounding is essential for maintaining clean waveform transitions in analog circuits.

#### **Summary**

- The updated schematic is well-designed for the purpose of **triangle-to-sine wave shaping** with added **amplitude control**.
- The **RV4 potentiometer** for adjusting the clipping level, along with the added series resistors, allows for precise control of the sine wave's curvature.
- The **RV3** amplitude control and **feedback network** are properly routed to provide both flexibility and stability to the output waveform.

These adjustments provide enhanced control over both the **shape** and **amplitude** of the output sine wave, making the circuit versatile for use in different synthesizer applications. If you need further assistance or have any more questions, feel free to ask!
