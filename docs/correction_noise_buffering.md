### **Detailed Schematic Routing for Noise Buffering Using TL072 and Waveform Mixing**

#### **Noise Buffering Using TL072**

1. **Buffered Noise Amplification**:
   - Start with the **filtered noise signal** output from the **filtered noise amplification stage**. This output comes from **pin 7** of **U5B (TL072)**.

2. **Connect to Buffer Op-Amp**:
   - Connect the output from **U5B (pin 7)** to the **non-inverting input (+)** of the buffer op-amp, which is **U6A (TL072)**.
   - Use a direct wire to connect **U5B (pin 7)** to **U6A (pin 3)**. This connection carries the filtered noise signal into the next op-amp stage.

3. **Voltage Follower Configuration**:
   - To configure **U6A (TL072)** as a **voltage follower**:
     - Connect the **output of U6A (pin 1)** directly to its **inverting input (-)**, which is **pin 2**.
     - This is done using a short wire to create a direct feedback loop, ensuring the op-amp operates as a unity gain buffer.
   - In this configuration, the output follows the input exactly, maintaining the analog characteristics of the signal.

4. **Buffered Noise Output**:
   - The buffered noise output is now taken from **pin 1** of **U6A**.
   - This output can be routed to the next stages, such as the **JFET-based VCAs** that blend the noise with the various waveforms.

5. **Power Connections**:
   - **VCC (+12V)**: Connect **pin 8** of **U6A** to **+12V**.
   - **VEE (-12V)**: Connect **pin 4** of **U6A** to **-12V**.
   - Ensure you have appropriate decoupling capacitors (e.g., **100nF**) between the power pins and ground to stabilize the power supply.

#### **Detailed Schematic Routing for Each Waveform**

1. **Waveform Outputs**:
   - Each waveform (SAW, TRI, SINE, PULSE) is generated by its respective oscillator circuitry and routed to the envelope follower for each waveform.

2. **Envelope Follower Configuration**:
   - **Diode and Capacitor Setup**:
     - Connect each waveform output to a **diode (1N4148)** followed by a **capacitor (10μF)** to create a control voltage that represents the envelope of each waveform.
     - The diode allows only the positive part of the signal to pass, and the capacitor smooths this signal to create a DC voltage proportional to the waveform amplitude.

3. **JFET-Based VCA Configuration**:
   - **JFET Selection**: Use **2N5457** JFETs (Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6) for each waveform.
   - **Drain Connection**: Connect the **drain** of each JFET to the **buffered noise output** from the **TL072 buffer stage (U6A, pin 1)**.
   - **Gate Connection**: Connect the **gate** of each JFET to the control voltage from the corresponding envelope follower.
     - Use a **series resistor (100kΩ)** for each gate connection to control the sensitivity.
   - **Source Connection**: Connect the **source** of each JFET to the **mixing resistor** before entering the summing op-amp.

4. **Summing Mixer Stage**:
   - **Op-Amp Selection**: Use **U6B, U7A, U7B, U8A (TL072)** for each waveform summing mixer.
   - **Mixing Resistor**: Connect each waveform output to a **mixing resistor (R21, R22, R23, R24 - 100kΩ)** before routing it to the **non-inverting input (+)** of the op-amp.
   - **Noise Input**: The noise signal controlled by the JFET is connected through another **mixing resistor (100kΩ)** to the **inverting input (-)** of the op-amp.
   - **Feedback Resistor**: Use a **feedback resistor (R26, R27, R28, R29 - 100kΩ)** to set the gain for each summing mixer stage.

5. **Power Connections for Summing Op-Amps**:
   - Connect **VCC (+12V)** to **pin 8** of each TL072.
   - Connect **VEE (-12V)** to **pin 4** of each TL072.
   - Place **decoupling capacitors (100nF)** close to the power pins to stabilize the power supply.
